//Instructions from your teacher:
//	The video game machines at your local arcade output coupons according to
//	how well you play the game. You can redeem 10 coupons for a candy bar or 3
//	coupons for a gumball. You prefer candy bars to gumballs. Write a program that
//	defines a variable initially assigned to the number of coupons you win. Next, 
//	the program should output how many candy bars and gumballs you can get if
//	you spend all of your coupons on candy bars first, and any remaining coupons
//	on gumballs.

//	if you the coupons are not enough for any redeem, display message:
//	"Not enough coupons"

	int coupons, candyBar,gumBall;
	 
	System.out.println("Enter number of coupons: ");
	coupons = scan.nextInt();
	
	System.out.println("Number of Candies: " + candyBar);
	candyBar = coupons/10;
